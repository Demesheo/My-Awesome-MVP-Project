# My-Awesome-MVP-Project


Project summary:
The idea behind this project is to create a geolocation tracker/log using gmaps.js, a javascript library built to make easy use of the google maps api. The user will be able
to post their location on the map, which will then be linked in chronological order to show a trail of their posts.

Short-Term expectations:
In the first 24 hours I expect to have a functioning map that is able to determine the current location and is able to accept posts to the map at the location.

In the next 12 hours I expect to be able link each post with a trail, with a link to the next and previous post.

In the 6 hours after that, I expect to be able to add a message/short description to each post.

Requirements:
*gmaps.js for rendering the map, accepting posts, and linking the posts with a trail
*moment.js for keeping track of time of posts in a visually friendly format
